# Welcome to Daily Mix History!

Have you ever been listening to Spotify, working your way through your Daily Mix and then at midnight they disappear into the abyss never to be seen again?

Well; no longer! This project retrieves and saves your Daily Mix 1 playlist on a daily basis so that you have a history of your Daily Mixes.

Assumptions:
- Client has configured application access to Spotify
- Lambda Environment contains the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and BUCKET_NAME
- Requests are added to the Lambda Function as a layer

Enjoy!
